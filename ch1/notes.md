# Definitions: along two dimensions:
* Thought processes and reasoning vs behavior
* Measured against human performance vs ideal concept of intelligence (rationality)

## Acting humanly: Characterized by the Turing Test. Requires:
* NLP
* Knowledge representation
* Automated reasoning
* Machine learning

## Thinking humanly: Modeling the human cognitive approach

## Thinking rationally: Using logic to do the right thing. Runs into two main obstacles:
* Representing knowledge when it is incomplete or uncertain. 
* Solving a problem in principle vs solving it in practice: computational cost argument

## Acting rationally: acting so as to achieve one's goals, given one's beliefs
Thinking rationally is neither necessary nor sufficient but frequently required for acting rationally.

Acting rationally is more amenable to scientific development than approaches based on human behavior or human though, because the standard of rationality is clearly defined and completely general.

* We will see before too long that achieving perfect rationality is not possible in complicated environments. The computational demands are just too high. This requires thinking under limited rationality.

* GodÃ«l's incompleteness theorem motivated Turing to characterize which functions _are_ capable of being computed. Turing showed that there were some functions that no Turing machine can compute; e.g. decidability. In practice, the problem of determining tractability is more important: polynomial vs exponential time. Therefore, one should divide the overall problem of generating intelligent behavior into tractable subproblems rather than intractable ones. The other important concept is that of reduction: transformation from one class of problems to another for which solutions exist.

* Any problem class to which an NP-complete problem class can be reduced is likely to be intractable.

> Despite the ever-increasing speed of computers, subtlety and careful use of resources will characterize intelligent systems. Put crudely, the world is an _extremely_ large problem instance!
