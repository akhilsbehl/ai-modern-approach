* An agent is what perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through effectors.

* What is rational at any given time depends on four things:
    1. The performance measure that defines degree of success.
    2. Everything that the agent has perceived so far: the complete perceptual history.
    3. What the agent knows about the environment.
    4. The actions that the agent _can_ perform.

* An ideal rational agent:
> For each possible percept sequence, an ideal rational agent should do whatever action is expected to maximize its performance measure, on the basis of the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.

* A mapping from a percept sequence to an action describes an agent's behavior. Therefore, an ideal mapping describes an ideal agent. _Specifiying which action an agent ought to take in response to any given percept sequence provides a design for an ideal agent._

* Autonomy: If the agent's actions are based completely on built-in knowledge, such that it need pay no attention to its percepts, then the agent lacks autonomy. An agent is autonomous to the extent that its behavior is determined by its own experience.
